			A service built to integrate with Lingoteks' translation service. It's purpose was to allow for <br/>
			project managers/admins/translators to manage projects and see live updates on translation jobs. <br/>
			This project had already been built out but while I was here I was the sole and lead developer on this service. <br/>
			<br/>
			I had a hand in facilitating it's development and then release process. One of which was rewriting part of the back-end architecture <br/>
			to closer match with the companies other services using apache2 instead of nginx. This process included lots of experience <br/>
			working with docker containers as well as working with HAProxy.
			<br/>
			<br/>
			In addition to this, I was also at times, tasked with working on 3rd party integrations for lingotek, mostly within Magento and Confluence.
